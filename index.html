                Hi! I'm Siri, the creator of this website! And yes, the picture above is from a year ago. Anyway, welcome to my website!! This section is all about who I am and why I created this website!
            </p>
            <p>
                Who am I? I'm a 10 year old girl who's learning to code! (And struggling, but I try to find an alternative if my website didn't come out as I wanted it to.) I like to read and play with my little sister. I am currently studying in George Bannerman Dealey.
            </p>
            <p>
                Why did I create this website? I created it because:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><p>I want to read more poems.</p></li>
                <li><p>I want to practice my HTML skills that I learnt so far.</p></li>
                <li><p>Just for fun?</p></li>
            </ol>
